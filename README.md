# ML-Pipeline-Disaster-tweets
Learn how machine learning pipelines are used in productions and design your first pipeline using simple steps on disaster tweets classification datasets. You will also learn how to ingest the data, preprocess, train, and eventually evaluate the results.

## Introduction
In this guide, we will learn the importance of Machine Learning (ML) pipelines and how to install and use Orchest platform. We will be also using Natural Language Processing beginner problem from Kaggle by classifying tweets into disaster and non-disaster tweets. The ML pipelines are independently executable code to run multiple tasks which include data preparation and training machine learning models. The figure below shows how each step has a specific role and how tracking those steps are easy. Azure Machine Learning
